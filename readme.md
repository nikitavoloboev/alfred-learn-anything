# Description

I wrote about why this workflow exists in an article. You can [read it here](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/opening-up-my-mind-%EF%B8%8F-575c8ece8a24). ✍🏻


You can search through  over 400 + curated Mind Maps from [Learn anything](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/learn-anything) with Alfred as well as search through the entirety of my notes and bookmarks and personal mind maps.

There are two unique searches available. You can either bind a hotkey to each one or use the keyword trigger to access these searches. Here are the searches : 

## 1. [Open any mind map from learn-anything 📚](https://learn-anything.xyz)

# Help extend it to other launchers 🎊

If you are interested in indexing these mind maps in this way but are not using macOS or Alfred. I am very interested in extending this implementation to other launchers like [Cerebro](https://cerebroapp.com/) or [Mutate](https://github.com/qdore/Mutate) or any other launcher. 

Essentially you have to parse [these markdown files](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind/tree/master/inside) with links to mind maps in a format that your launcher supports. If you do have the time or interest for it, I am open to any kind of pull request to add support to more launchers.

# Thank you 💙

Big thank you to [Vitor](https://github.com/vitorgalvao) who kindly shared the script to parse the markdown files and [Dean](https://github.com/deanishe) who sorted out the mess I was doing with trying to set this workflow up.
