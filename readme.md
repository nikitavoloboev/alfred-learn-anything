Clicking on any of them will open the contents of the mind map with all the links and inside mind maps :

Clicking on results with 🗺 will let you see the contents of that mind map in Alfred.


## 4. Search through my personal research

It mostly contains notes and various links related to the topic. Essentially it allows you to open any mind map from [here](https://my.mindnode.com/P2WTfATNrnsxm23L7jQMotnJhzeh41sWWH2jgZzU#-36.3,-44.2,0) in seconds.

# Help extend it to other launchers 🎊

If you are interested in indexing these mind maps in this way but are not using macOS or Alfred. I am very interested in extending this implementation to other launchers like [Cerebro](https://cerebroapp.com/) or [Mutate](https://github.com/qdore/Mutate) or any other launcher. 

Essentially you have to parse [these markdown files](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-knowledge-map/tree/master/md) with links to mind maps in a format that your launcher supports. If you do have the time or interest for it, I am open to any kind of pull request to add support to more launchers.

# Thank you 💙

Big thank you to [Vitor](https://github.com/vitorgalvao) who kindly shared the script to parse the markdown files and [Dean](https://github.com/deanishe) who sorted out the mess I was doing with trying to set this workflow up.
