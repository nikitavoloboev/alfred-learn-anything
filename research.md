set of steps for packing data into a smaller space, while allowing for the original data to be seen again, compression is a two way process: a compression algorithm can be used to make a data package smaller but it can also be run the other way, to decompress the package into its original form

### general relativity

## [gravity](https://my.mindnode.com/VUyUTfxgXZ5p5hqFm5dDqPxSqqfyuh7yzp6KGSSX)

one of the fundamental forces, some physicists think gravity is caused by gravitons, but they are still unsure

### [gravitational waves](https://my.mindnode.com/8qsuRyALoCgHFWkuaBzpWNWM41ppDw1UoxWvYqrm)

are ripples in spacetime which are created whenever objects with mass move

### [quantum gravity](https://my.mindnode.com/riMuKgoii4syDPAu8Z4Psbwrv7p2ySamiNMxbNWu)

the goal of quantum gravity is to develop a theory which contains both general relativity and quantum mechanics, however combining the theories of the big and the small is very difficult in practice

## [energy](https://my.mindnode.com/pBzAbjrNDE84CCDdohynDW3BToNYdvp7d1Smr6nH)

how much potential a physical system has to change, energy is a property of matter, it can be transferred between objects, and converted in form, it cannot be created or destroyed

## [time](https://my.mindnode.com/SewzcjSiPtry5MDXBwhL3KyCMu2bh3hzzEvxEauz)

we use time to sequence events, to compare their durations and the intervals between them, and to quantify the speed at which objects move and things change

## [particles](https://my.mindnode.com/Juzorpq28GxjqzBQh9zQJsT85UhgHqPsYENstpFx)

are tiny bits of matter that make up everything in the universe, in particle physics, an elementary particle is a particle which cannot be plist up into smaller pieces

### [higgs boson](https://my.mindnode.com/BqKXsxhPS3crZBo9XhzHpgyDvuhsAFVS68K4EDDm)

### [photons](https://my.mindnode.com/GQwMptycqQ31CsBKDpwvVxy9KDs8kQFUMEgs2bMv)

are particles which transmit light, in other words, light is carried over space by photons, a photon is an elementary particle that is its own antiparticle, in quantum mechanics each photon has a characteristic quantum of energy

## [light](https://my.mindnode.com/38g72sjsYjJAgmatFmi2dME1XvEvpDN7ZgaDjvGP)

is a type of energy, it is a form of electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength which can be detected by the human eye, it is a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum and radiation given off by stars like the sun

## [waves](https://my.mindnode.com/kHbyKQxtnpQugwU4bdVKoC8zqTyDFwygXZyT5bsy)

have properties that can be measured, all waves can be pictured by adding sine waves, sine waves can be measured too, the shape of a sine wave is given by its amplitude, phase, wavelength and frequency, the speed that the sine wave moves can also be measured

## [fields](https://my.mindnode.com/Upn7kNaRSwZNsitT2jpF5xuuc6cKgBT6voU9jYbR)

means that a physical quantity is assigned to every point in space (or, more generally spacetime), a field is seen as extending throughout a large region of space so that it influences everything, the strength of a field usually varies over a region

### [electromagnetic](https://my.mindnode.com/KGyL9jP2JWPHzPuyUp5uxJgrFD4UEefSnsS6WoAh)

## [radiation](https://my.mindnode.com/3mKNiSKRkZgfBWVYzHJmgcLvXc8sAMuhJJNz6YHz)

## [antimatter](https://my.mindnode.com/TaYApZzCDVHkk6y5gVgPQvqPbRzTTUmmy7d5p1wg)

is a material composed of antiparticles, these have the same mass as particles of ordinary matter but have opposite charge and properties, such as lepton and baryon number
